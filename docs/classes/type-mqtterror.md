# type MQTTError

There is a [notify](//classes/interface-mqttconnectionnotify.md) function, `on_error(conn: MQTTConnection ref, err: MQTTError, info: String)`, that receives one of the possible `Stringable`primitives of an MQTTError to represent a raised error, and any additional information if applicable. You may choose to handle or ignore them.

It may be one of the following:
