# Pony-MQTT

[Pony-MQTT](https://github.com/EpicEric/pony-mqtt) is a library implementing an
MQTT client. It allows you to connect to an MQTT broker and exchange messages
through TCP. It complies with the
[MQTT 3.1](http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/dw/webservices/ws-mqtt/mqtt-v3r1.html)
and the
[MQTT 3.1.1](http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-os.html)
standards.

This project is implemented in the Pony programming language, providing
high-performance accesses in a multi-threaded, race-free environment.
You can find more information about Pony
[on the official website](https://www.ponylang.org/).

The Pony-MQTT project is entirely maintained
[on GitHub](https://github.com/EpicEric/pony-mqtt).
You can install it with
[Pony Stable](https://github.com/ponylang/pony-stable).
